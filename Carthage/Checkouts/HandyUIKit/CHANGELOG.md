All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

<details>
<summary>Formatting Rules for Entries</summary>
Each entry should use the following format:

```markdown
- Summary of what was changed in a single line using past tense & followed by two whitespaces.  
  Issue: [#0](https://github.com/Flinesoft/HandySwift/issues/0) | PR: [#0](https://github.com/Flinesoft/HandySwift/pull/0) | Author: [Cihat Gündüz](https://github.com/Jeehut)
```

Note that at the end of the summary line, you need to add two whitespaces (`  `) for correct rendering on GitHub.

If needed, pluralize to `Tasks`, `PRs` or `Authors` and list multiple entries separated by `, `. Also, remove entries not needed in the second line.
